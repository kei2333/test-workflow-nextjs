## Project Ideas
- Website for generating test workflows with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Left panel: List of functions (function1-5)
  - Right panel: Blank canvas for building test process
  - Drag functions from left to right to create test workflow
  - Run button in top-right corner to execute the created test flow
  - Initial implementation will print English confirmation message for each function when test is run
